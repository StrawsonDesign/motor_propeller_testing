# motor_propeller_testing

Collection of brushless motor and propeller tests performed on an RC Benchmark 1520 thrust test stand.

All the figures are automatically stored into the testresults folder. Motorside folder means the figures contained are comparisons of the performances between multiple propellers on one motor, while propellerside folder contains the figures as comparisons between multiple motors on single propeller. Besides, the eachexperiment folder contains figures portraying each experiment.
The modifieddata folder contains the data files with all rebounding data points deleted (overridden by the data points with maximum thrusts). The rawdata folder contains the unchanged data files. Have fun playing with the data and figures!
